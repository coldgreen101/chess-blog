## Summary

a) I played reasonably well in the opening, although I was out of book very early on.

b) I outplayed my opponent in an IQP position.

c) I didn't calculate deeply enough at critical moments (over-confidence), giving my opponent chances for holding a draw.

## Analysis

1. **d4 d5** 2. **Nf3 Nf6** 3. **e3**

I have only played against this line once before, and in this game I was out of book from this point on.

Typical pawn move in this structure to control more of the center!

4. **b3**

5. **Bb2 Bf5**
   - Developing bishop outside pawn chain.

6. Bd3 Bg6
   - Considered exchanging on d3 but didn't want to ease White's development.

   7. O-O cxd4
      - Struggled to find comfort after alternatives.

      8. exd4?!
         - Ideas with c2-c4 pawn break, but b2-bishop lacks prospects.
         - **Subvariation:** (8. Nxd4! 8... e5?? 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bxe5)

   9. Ne5?!
      - Unprincipled move, moving developed piece while b2-knight remains inactive.
      - **Subvariation:** (9. Nbd2)

   10. Qxd3 Bd6 11. Nd2 O-O 12. c4?!
       - White aims for c4 after ...dxc4, missing tactical opportunities.
       - **Subvariation:** (12... dxc4 13. Qe3? (13. Ndxc4!))

   13. Qe3? Nd5 14. Qf3 cxb3?!
       - Inaccurate, c3! was stronger, winning a piece.
       - **Subvariation:** (14... c3! 15. Bxc3 (15. Nxc6?! 15... Qc7! 16. Bxc3 Bxh2+ 17. Kh1 Qxc6 $17) 15... Nxc3 16. Nxc6! (16. Qxc3?? Bb4! 17. Qe3 Nxe5 18. Qxe5 (18. dxe5 Qxd2)))

   15. Nxb3 Rc8
       - Reluctant to change pawn structure, but Nxe5! was stronger.
       - **Subvariation:** (15... Nxe5! 16. dxe5 Be7 $15)

   17. h4? Ng6?!
       - Slight inaccuracy, Nf5! was better.
       - **Subvariation:** (17... Nf5! )

   20. g4? Bxe5?!
       - Unnecessary exchange, Nf4! kept attacking chances.
       - **Subvariation:** (20... Nf4!)

   23. Kh2?? Qf4+?!
       - Unnecessary exchange of queens, Nf4! maintained pressure.
       - **Subvariation:** (23... Nf4!)

   29. f4? Rc3+! 30. Kh4?? Ng6+ 0-1
       - White's position collapses under pressure.
