## Summary

a) I played reasonably well in the opening, although I was out of book very early on.

b) I outplayed my opponent in an IQP position.

c) I didn't calculate deeply enough at critical moments (over-confidence), giving my opponent chances for holding a draw.

## Analysis

1. **d4 d5** 2. **Nf3 Nf6** 3. **e3**

I have only played against this line once before, and in this game I was out of book from this point on.

3 <span style="color: #00895A">**...c5!**</span>

Typical pawn move in this structure to control more of the center!

4. **b3**

---

I have never encountered this 4. b3 line before. Initially, I thought it is quite dubious, but it turns out it is theory and it's called the Colle-Zuckertort System.

According to Toth's Chessable course the immediate ...cxd4! is the right approach.
The explanation being: "This is a rare example when releasing tension in the center is benefiting us. After the trade, the bishop on b2 will be biting into granite, having no real prospects!"

Example Chessable variation: (4...<span style="color: #00895A">cxd4!</span> 5. exd4 (5. <span style="color: #FF9500">Nxd4?</span> Note: A mistake due to <span style="color: #00895A">...e5!</span> 6. Nf3 Nc6âˆ“ "and Black dominates the center! Plan of ...Bg4, ...Bd6 and ...O-O gives Black a great position.") ...Nc6 6. Bd3 (denying ...Bf5) ...<span style="color: #00895A">Bg4!</span> 7. Bb2 <span style="color: #00895A">Qa5+!</span>)

5. **Bb2 Bf5**

   - Developing the bishop outside the pawn chain.

6. **Bd3 Bg6**

   - Considered exchanging on d3 but didn't want to ease White's development.

   7. O-O cxd4

      - Struggled to find comfort after alternatives.

      8. exd4?!
         - Ideas with c2-c4 pawn break, but b2-bishop lacks prospects.
         - **Subvariation:** (8. Nxd4! 8... e5?? 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bxe5)

   8. Ne5?!

      - Unprincipled move, moving developed piece while b2-knight remains inactive.
      - **Subvariation:** (9. Nbd2)

   9. Qxd3 Bd6 11. Nd2 O-O 12. c4?!

      - White aims for c4 after ...dxc4, missing tactical opportunities.
      - **Subvariation:** (12... dxc4 13. Qe3? (13. Ndxc4!))

   10. Qe3? Nd5 14. Qf3 cxb3?!

       - Inaccurate, c3! was stronger, winning a piece.
       - **Subvariation:** (14... c3! 15. Bxc3 (15. Nxc6?! 15... Qc7! 16. Bxc3 Bxh2+ 17. Kh1 Qxc6 $17) 15... Nxc3 16. Nxc6! (16. Qxc3?? Bb4! 17. Qe3 Nxe5 18. Qxe5 (18. dxe5 Qxd2)))

   11. Nxb3 Rc8

       - Reluctant to change pawn structure, but Nxe5! was stronger.
       - **Subvariation:** (15... Nxe5! 16. dxe5 Be7 $15)

   12. h4? Ng6?!

       - Slight inaccuracy, Nf5! was better.
       - **Subvariation:** (17... Nf5! )

   13. g4? Bxe5?!

       - Unnecessary exchange, Nf4! kept attacking chances.
       - **Subvariation:** (20... Nf4!)

   14. Kh2?? Qf4+?!

       - Unnecessary exchange of queens, Nf4! maintained pressure.
       - **Subvariation:** (23... Nf4!)

   15. f4? Rc3+! 30. Kh4?? Ng6+ 0-1
       - White's position collapses under pressure.
