## Summary
a) I played reasonably well in the opening, although I was out of book very early on.

b) I outplayed my opponent in an IQP position.

c) I didn't calculate deeply enough at critical moments (over-confidence), giving my opponent chances for holding a draw.

## Analysis

I have only played against this line once before, and in this game I was out of book from this point on.

Typical pawn move in this structure to control more of the center!

**4. b3**
