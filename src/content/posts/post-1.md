## Summary

a) I played reasonably well in the opening, although I was out of book very early on.

b) I outplayed my opponent in an IQP position.

c) I didn't calculate deeply enough at critical moments (over-confidence), giving my opponent chances for holding a draw.

## Analysis

1. **d4 d5** 2. **Nf3 Nf6** 3. **e3**

I have only played against this line once before, and in this game I was out of book from this point on.

Typical pawn move in this structure to control more of the center!

4. **b3**

I have never encountered this 4. b3 line before. Initially, I thought it is quite dubious, but it turns out it is theory and it's called the Colle-Zuckertort System.

According to Toth's Chessable course the immediate ...cxd4! is the right approach.
The explanation being: "This is a rare example when releasing tension in the center is benefiting us. After the trade, the bishop on b2 will be biting into granite, having no real prospects!"

Example Chessable variation: (4...<span style="color: #00895A">cxd4!</span> 5. exd4 (5. <span style="color: #FF9500">Nxd4?</span> Note: A mistake due to <span style="color: #00895A">...e5!</span> 6. Nf3 Nc6∓ "and Black dominates the center! Plan of ...Bg4, ...Bd6 and ...O-O gives Black a great position.") ...Nc6 6. Bd3 (denying ...Bf5) ...<span style="color: #00895A">Bg4!</span> 7. Bb2 <span style="color: #00895A">Qa5+!</span> "This check seems silly, as it forces White to play Nbd2, which is what they want to do anyway, but we have a trick or two up our sleeve! 8. Nbd2 <span style="color: #00895A">Nb4!</span> "White is already in trouble since ...Nxd3 is a threat they can't possibly allow." 9.Qe2 (9. <span style="color: #FF9500">Be2?</span> Bxf3 10. Bxf3 Qc7 "and White has no good way to defend the c2 pawn") ...Nxd3+ "obtaining the bishop pair!" 10. Qxd3 e6 11. c3 "A sad necessity, as (11. <span style="color: #FF9500">O-O?</span>"loses the c2 pawn after" ...<span style="color: #00895A">Bf5!</span>") ...Bd6 12. O-O O-O "Black is firmly on top. We can choose to play in the center with ...Bf5 and ...Ne4, but the restrictive ...b7-b5, followed by ...Rac8 is also very attractive")

4... **Nc6** 5. **Bb2 Bf5**

---

Developing the bishop outside the pawn chain.

6. **Bd3 Bg6**

---

Considered exchanging on d3 but didn't want to ease White's development.

7. **O-O cxd4**

---

Struggled to find comfort after: (7...e6 8. Ba3 b6 9. Bb5 (8...<span style="color: #00895A">Qa5!</span> I overlooked this resource which relieves all pressure with tempo!)).

8. <span style="color: #017FC0">**exd4?!**</span>

---

There are ideas with c2-c4 pawn break, but the b2-bishop is biting on granite.
(8. <span style="color: #00895A">Nxd4!</span> 8... e5?? 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bxe5)

8.  Ne5?!

    - Unprincipled move, moving developed piece while b2-knight remains inactive.
    - **Subvariation:** (9. Nbd2)

9.  Qxd3 Bd6 11. Nd2 O-O 12. c4?!

    - White aims for c4 after ...dxc4, missing tactical opportunities.
    - **Subvariation:** (12... dxc4 13. Qe3? (13. Ndxc4!))

10. Qe3? Nd5 14. Qf3 cxb3?!

    - Inaccurate, c3! was stronger, winning a piece.
    - **Subvariation:** (14... c3! 15. Bxc3 (15. Nxc6?! 15... Qc7! 16. Bxc3 Bxh2+ 17. Kh1 Qxc6 $17) 15... Nxc3 16. Nxc6! (16. Qxc3?? Bb4! 17. Qe3 Nxe5 18. Qxe5 (18. dxe5 Qxd2)))

11. Nxb3 Rc8

    - Reluctant to change pawn structure, but Nxe5! was stronger.
    - **Subvariation:** (15... Nxe5! 16. dxe5 Be7 $15)

12. h4? Ng6?!

    - Slight inaccuracy, Nf5! was better.
    - **Subvariation:** (17... Nf5! )

13. g4? Bxe5?!

    - Unnecessary exchange, Nf4! kept attacking chances.
    - **Subvariation:** (20... Nf4!)

14. Kh2?? Qf4+?!

    - Unnecessary exchange of queens, Nf4! maintained pressure.
    - **Subvariation:** (23... Nf4!)

15. f4? Rc3+! 30. Kh4?? Ng6+ 0-1
    - White's position collapses under pressure.
