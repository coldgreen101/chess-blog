## Initial thoughts
a) I played reasonably well in the opening, although I was out of book very early on.

b) I outplayed my opponent in an IQP position

c) I didn't calculate deeply enough at critical moments (over-confidence), giving my opponent chances for holding a draw.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
